    "aggregated_response": "**Simple Strategy for Reducing Urban Traffic Congestion**\n\nA simple strategy to reduce urban traffic congestion using technology and policy interventions is to implement a dynamic pricing system combined with smart public transportation. This approach involves three key components:\n\n1. **Dynamic Pricing:** Implement dynamic pricing on highways and major roads, where tolls are adjusted in real-time based on traffic conditions. During peak hours, tolls increase to discourage travel, while during off-peak hours, tolls decrease to encourage travel.\n2. **Smart Public Transportation:** Implement a smart public transportation system that provides real-time information, optimized routes, and efficient scheduling to reduce travel time and increase ridership.\n3. **Encourage Alternative Modes:** Encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and carpooling, by providing dedicated infrastructure and incentives.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following strategies to further optimize traffic management:\n\n* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Use data analytics to monitor traffic patterns, identify bottlenecks,",

During peak hours, tolls increase to discourage travel, while during off-peak hours, tolls decrease to encourage travel.\n2. **Congestion Pricing:** Introduce congestion pricing zones in urban areas, where drivers are charged a fee to enter the zone during peak hours. The revenue generated is used to fund public transportation, pedestrian, and cycling infrastructure.\n3. **Smart Lane Management:** Utilize intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to monitor traffic conditions, optimize lane usage, and dynamically adjust traffic signals to minimize congestion.\n4. **Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS):** Encourage the use of shared mobility options like carpooling, bike-sharing, and",
