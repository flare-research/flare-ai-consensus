The fee would be based on the time of day and the type of vehicle, with higher fees for larger, more polluting vehicles. This would encourage drivers to avoid these areas during peak hours, reducing congestion and improving air quality.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **Smart Congestion Pricing**: Implement a dynamic pricing system for entering congested areas during peak hours. This means charging higher tolls for driving in congested areas during peak hours and lower tolls during off-peak hours. This will encourage people to either avoid driving during peak hours or use alternative modes of transportation. To implement this, cities can use ANPR",

Additionally, the revenue generated from the congestion fees could be used to fund public transportation and other infrastructure improvements that would further reduce traffic congestion.\n\nThis strategy combines the benefits of dynamic pricing and congestion pricing to create a more efficient and sustainable transportation system. By leveraging technology and policy interventions, cities can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote more sustainable transportation options."
