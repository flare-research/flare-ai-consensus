This involves charging drivers a fee to enter certain areas of the city during peak hours, such as downtown or the central business district. The fee would be based on the time of day and the type of vehicle, with higher fees for larger and more polluting vehicles. This would encourage drivers to use public transportation, carpool, or take other forms of transportation that are less likely to contribute to traffic congestion and air pollution. Additionally, the revenue generated from the congestion fees could be used to fund improvements to public transportation systems, such as expanding bus routes or building new subway lines.
