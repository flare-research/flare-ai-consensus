The thermal mass effect of the paint, where it absorbs and releases heat over time, can also play a role in making the room feel warmer.\n\nIt's worth noting that the warmth may not be directly caused by the people in the room, but rather by the physical properties of the paint and the environment. Therefore, it's not necessarily related to the presence or absence of individuals in the room.",
