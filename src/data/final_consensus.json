As the paint dries, these solvents and VOCs evaporate into the air, carrying heat with them. This process of evaporation is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surrounding environment, resulting in a cooler temperature in the room.\n\nAdditionally, the paint itself also emits heat as it dries due to the exothermic chemical reactions that occur during the drying process. These reactions involve the breakdown of the paint's components, releasing energy in the form of heat. This heat is then distributed throughout the room, contributing to the overall warmth",
